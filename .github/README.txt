RISC-V CPU Emulator with WebAssembly Support
 
This repository contains a RISC-V CPU emulator designed to simulate hardware and execute RISC-V instructions. The project is open to contributions and research, with a focus on enabling WebAssembly (Wasm) support through Emscripten for browser integration. The emulator provides a flexible and extensible platform for experimenting with RISC-V architectures and exploring hardware emulation concepts.

Features:
- RISC-V CPU Emulation: Implements a basic RISC-V CPU with support for a subset of the RISC-V instruction set.
- WebAssembly Support: Compiles to WebAssembly using Emscripten, enabling integration into web browsers.
- Extensible Design: Modular architecture for easy extension and experimentation.
- Memory Management: Simulates memory with bounds checking and dynamic resizing.
- System Calls: Supports basic system calls (e.g., exit, write) for program interaction.
- Open for Research: Encourages contributions and research in hardware emulation and RISC-V architectures.

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/kabeer11000/riscv.git
   cd riscv

Repository Structure:
- src/: Source code for the RISC-V emulator
- build/: Build directory (generated)
- examples/: Example RISC-V binaries for testing
- docs/: Documentation and technical details
- CMakeLists.txt: CMake build configuration
- LICENSE: License file
- README.md: This file

Usage:
The emulator can execute RISC-V binaries by loading them into memory and simulating the CPU's fetch-decode-execute cycle. Example usage:
RISCVCpu cpu;
cpu.load_program(program, 0x00000000); // Load program at memory address 0
cpu.run(); // Start emulation

Supported Instructions:

- I-type: ADDI, SLTI, SLTIU, XORI, ORI, ANDI, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI, LB, LH, LW, LBU, LHU, JALR
- S-type: SB, SH, SW
- B-type: BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU
- U-type: LUI, AUIPC
- J-type: JAL
